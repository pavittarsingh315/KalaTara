TODOS:
   1. Remove the TemporaryObject table from the database and instead use Redis. You can give this an expires flag in Redis which will auto delete the object when its expired. Also its a lot quicker cause ya know it'd be in memory.

GOOD IDEAS:
   1. Caching User and Profile as one object in Redis:
      a. In both login routes, when the user and profile is fetched from the database, cache them as one object in Redis.
      b. In the auth middleware, first try to get the user/profile obj from Redis. If they don't exist, query the DB and put them in cache.
      c. Don't set an expiration time when caching the user/profile obj. Websocket connection will remove them from cache when they disconnect.
      d. When a user updates their user model or profile model via the API, in that route, update the user/profile object in Redis.
      e. When a user is deleted, delete them from Redis.

   2. Websockets:
      a. Establish a websocket connection with the user. Do this when they first load the app or webpage.
      b. When they disconnect, remove their user/profile object from Redis cache.
      c. Listen to mysql binary logs to stream events from mysql and get real-time data updates. We can use this to send notifications.

   3. Notifications:
      a. Use mysql binary logs to stream events from mysql. So for example when an object is created, a log is created. We can stream such events and get real-time data updates.
      b. When creating notification objects, check whether the user who will get the notification is in Redis. If they are that means they're online.
      c. If the user who will get the notification is offline, have Firbase Cloud Messaging send a notification.
      d. If the user who will get the notification is online, then capture the notification obj from the binary log and send it to the user across the Websocket connection.
